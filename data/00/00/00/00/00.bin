  |   In this surreal Japanese-style RPG set in the '90s, prepare to        |
  |   experience a conspiracy like no other.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   After witnessing a woman vanish from an elevator, college graduate    |
  |   Alex embarks on an adventure to rescue her, which spirals into an     |
  |   epic quest with stakes higher than he could have ever imagined.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Alex's search for the woman and the truth behind her disappearance    |
  |   lead him and his companions towards the new millennium, on a          |
  |   journey rife with mystery and danger... or so goes the tale of        |
  |   YIIK: A Postmodern RPG, the surreal Japanese-style RPG from Ackk      |
  |   Studios and Ysbryd Games.                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Battle through dungeons littered with puzzles, traps, and bizarre     |
  |   monsters with a party of up to eight members, using a combat system   |
  |   that blends twitchy minigames with turn-based combat. Brandish        |
  |   records, cameras, musical instruments and more against enemies        |
  |   ranging from floating, yammering skulls to tortoise samurais.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   YIIK has more than 30 hours of content including a fully-voiced       |
  |   main story campaign featuring talents such as Chris Niosi (Tales of   |
  |   Zestiria, Disgaea 5), Clifford Chapin (Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,   |
  |   Attack on Titan, RWBY) and more.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Polygonal rendering, lack of textures and a rich, saturated color     |
  |   scheme lend to the dreamlike, otherworldly qualities of the           |
  |   environments and their inhabitants. The soundtrack - including        |
  |   contributions from composers such as Toby Fox (Undertale) and         |
  |   Hiroki Kikuta (Secret of Mana) - is as eclectic as the gameplay,      |
  |   featuring an electroacoustic fusion of jazz, funk, traditional        |
  |   JRPG-style tunes and swing.                                           |
  |                                                                         |
